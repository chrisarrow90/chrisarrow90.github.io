              <strong>Inquisitive</strong> &#8212; My inquisitive nature makes me a flexible problem
              solver striking a good balance between thinking and doing.

          <h3>My Weaknesses</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Focus</strong> &#8212; My inquisitive nature can lead me to being unable to
              stay focused on learning a single topic with a preference of pratice over theory.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reserved</strong> &#8212; Being introverted can make establishing new
              relationships challenging and coming across initially as quite reserved.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Leadership</strong> &#8212; I tend to shy away from leadership positions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Critical</strong> &#8212; I hold myself to high standard and can be quite hard
              on myself if I don't perform as well as I had hoped.
            </li>
