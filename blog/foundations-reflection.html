          <h4>
            What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of
            the core learning?
          </h4>
          <p>
            I discovered more about my personality type and the areas I need to be concious about
            particularly when working in group environments such as to avoid coming across as or
            being reserved. Also I need to be careful with my communication style and be concious of
            others' emotions/feelings (as Virtuosos can tend to have a blunt way of communicating
            since they deal with logic and facts).
          </p>
          <h4>
            What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Empathy is important for developing strong relationships and group cohesion. It allows
            us to connect with and work at a deeper level with our customers and colleagues. By
            understanding and respecting their needs and emotions, it will lead to a more happier
            and productive workplace and produce better results. Empathy also enables us to better
            deal with conflicts and disagreements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self awareness allows us to reflect on how we learn best and therefore we can adjust our
            learning styles and environment in a way that suits us best. It also allows us to
            identify our areas of weakness, or when we are felling frustrated and therefore we will
            be able to take steps to rectify these situations before they become a problem.

          <h4>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h4>
          <p>
            Coming from a background as a Pilot, alot of these concepts are familiar as I have spent
            a lot of time learning about Human Factors and Performance. It is interesting to note
            many of the soft-skills required to be a pilot equally apply to the Web Development and
            Programming industry.
          </p>
          <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
          <p>
            Self-reflection has been the most challenging aspect as I often find it hard to write
            about myself or my thoughts. Also writing blogs/creative writing is not my forte.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Why do you think we are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
            development bootccamp course?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Because soft skills are cruicial to being a well rounded programmer and employers are
            placing increasing value on soft skills, just as much as, if not more than technical
            skills. They are probably also the hardest to develop and requires a lot of self
            reflection which we typically do not do much of.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should
            you have just used that time to practice programming instead?
          </h4>
          <p>
            No. I think one of the greatest benefit from this program comes from the huge focus on
            core learning and soft skills. If I just wanted to learn programming there would be
            plenty of free online resources to do so. But the greatest value in this course will
            come from the soft skills development. The core learning during foundations has been
            very insightful and useful.
