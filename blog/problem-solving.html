          <p>
            As I can't think of a specific situation where I got blocked off the top of my head, I
            will instead explore the various problem solving techniques useful to programmers.
          </p>
          <h4>Understand the Problem</h4>
          <p>
            It is too easy to attempt to rush into solving a problem before actually taking the time
            to fully understand the problem carefully. How do you know when you understand a
            problem? When you can explain it in plain english.
          </p>
          <p>
            To assist in this process, write down the problem in plain english. Draw a diagram. Tell
            someone else about it. (Use the RubberDuck method)
          </p>
          <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
          <p>
            Going hand and hand with understanding the problem is pseudocode. Writing out the
            problem in pseudocode allows you to break the problem up into a series of steps and
            write the problem in plain language without getting bogged down in the technicalities or
            code specific syntax to begin with. This helps you plan out your solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the best ways to write pseudocode is using comments directly in your code. For
            example, suppose we want to write a function that will take an array of numbers and
            return a new array of numbers from that array that are even. Our pseudocode might look
            like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>// function to select even numbers from an array
  // create an empty array to hold the even numbers

  // for each number in the original array
    // check to see if number is even
    // (divisible by 2 with no remainder)
    // if even add to the array of even numbers
  // return the array of even numbers</code></pre>
          <p>We can use this as the basis for writing the code:</p>
          <pre>
<code>// function to select even numbers from an array
function selectEvenNumbers(nums) {
  // create an empty array to hold the even numbers
  let evenNums = [];
  // for each number in the original array
  nums.forEach(num => {
    // check to see if number is even 
    // (divisible by 2 with no remainder)
    if (num % 2 == 0) {
      // if even add to the array of even numbers
      evenNums.push(num);
    }
  })

  // return the array of even numbers 
  return evenNums;</code></pre>
          <h4>Refactoring</h4>
          <p>Once you have a workable solution, you can then go back and optimise:</p>
          <pre>
<code>let selectEvenNumbers = nums => nums.filter(n => n % 2 == 0);</code></pre>
          <h4>console.log()</h4>
          <p>
            Console log is a very useful tool for debugging. You can place it anywhere inside your
            code block to check the current values of variables.
          </p>
          <h4>Divide and Conquer</h4>
          <p>
            Also known as 'reduce the problem' technique, often it is easier to break complex
            problems down into smaller sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
            Start with the simplest (the part you know how to solve). Then expand the problem
            slightly and rewrite your solution to match.
          </p>
          <h4>Simplify the Problem</h4>
          <p>
            Different than dividing the problem, it is about reducing the scope of the problem.
            Suppose you are tasked with writing a program to find the third highest number in an
            array. Start with how would you find the highest number in the array.
          </p>
          <h4>Getting Unstuck</h4>
          <p>
            Take a deep breath! Go for a walk and get some fresh air. This will allow you to clear
            your head and maybe you will come up with a fresh idea. Don't just sit their banging
            your head against the screen.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Debug - Go through your code and try to find where you went wrong. Use console.log and
              check values of variables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Error Messages - Take the time to read them carefully. Understand what went wrong, why
              it went wrong and where it went wrong.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reasess - Take a step back. Try look from another perspective. Maybe even delete your
              code and start again!
            </li>
            <li>
              Research - Highly likely someone has tried to solve the same problem. Start with
              google or stackoverflow.
            </li>
