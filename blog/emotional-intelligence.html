          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence, known as EQ for short, is the ability to understand, use and
            manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively,
            empathise with others, overcome challenges and diffuse conflict. People with high
            emotional intellgence are able to recognise their own emotions and those of others and
            use emotional information to guide their thinking and behaviour, adapting it to their
            environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at school and
            work and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you connect with your
            feelings, turn intention into action and make informed decisions about what matters most
            to you.
