          <h3>The difference between HTML and CSS</h3>
          <p>
            To explore the difference between HTML and CSS I will use the analogy of a house. HTML
            can be thought of as the structure or framework of the house. It specifies the makeup of
            the house, what sections are the hallway, what sections are bedrooms, what section is
            the kitchen and so on. It also includes the contents of those sections such as a bedroom
            contains a bed, wardrobe, drawers and maybe a desk.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can drill down even further, a bed is made up of a matress, pillows and a duvet and
            so on. You can think of these as 'children' of the parent element the 'bed' which is
            itself a child element of the bedroom, which itself is a child element of the house.
          </p>
          <h4>House Represented as HTML elements</h4>
          <pre>
<code>&lt;house&gt;
  &lt;kitchen&gt;
    &lt;cupboard&gt;
      &lt;plate /&gt;
      &lt;cup /&gt;
    &lt;/cupboard&gt;
    &lt;sink /&gt;
  &lt;/kitchen&gt;
  &lt;bedroom&gt;
    &lt;bed&gt;
      &lt;pillow&gt;
      &lt;duvet&gt;
    &lt;/bed&gt;
  &lt;/bedroom&gt;
&lt;/house&gt;  
</code></pre>
          <h4>Website Made up of HTML Elements</h4>
          <p>
            Just as above, a web-page is made up of elements, and HTML provides the semantic
            structure of what is what.
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Webpage Title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>
            HTML in itself is pretty boring however. This information is read by the browser which
            then uses default styles to apply to each element, such as how large should a h1 heading
            be, what is the font-size of a paragraph, what colour should the text be and the default
            positioning of these elements. Here is what it looks like:
          </p>
          <img class="basic-html-example" src="images/basic_html.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>Stunning!</p>
          <p>
            This is where <strong>CSS</strong> comes in. Back to our house analogy... You can think
            of CSS as the interior decoration of the house and also the layout. For example CSS
            would be responsible for the positioning of furniture items in the room, specifying how
            large each of the rooms should be, the colour of the walls, the brightness of the lights
            and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS uses <strong>selectors</strong> to select an element of the HTML, or in our house
            anology select an item like the bed, a room, carpet etc. And then applies
            <strong>declarations</strong> to change the appearance of that item. Let's say we want
            to specify the bed to have a width of 1.2 metres, a height of 2.2 metres, colour of
            light blue and positioned in the top-left of the bedroom. We would do this as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>bed {
  width: 1.2m,
  height: 2.2m,
  color: light-blue,
  top: 0,
  left: 0  
}  
</code></pre>
          <p>
            But wait a minute, I hear you say... We might have more than one bed in the house, we
            don't want all beds to necessarily be in the same position, or have the same colour or
            width. We can add a <strong>class name</strong> to each of our bed (or HTML elements) to
            target specific instances of it as shown below.
          </p>
          <p>First in the HTML we would specify the following:</p>
          <pre>
<code>&lt;bed class="lucys-bed"&gt;
&lt;/bed&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>Now we can target that specifc class name in the CSS as follows:</p>
          <pre>
<code>.lucys-bed {
  width: 0.6m,
  height: 2.2m,
  color: pink,
}</code></pre>
        </section>

          <h3>Control Flow in JavaScript</h3>
          <h4>What is Control Flow?</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Control flow</strong> is used to describe the order in which the computer runs
            or executes the code in your program. In JavaScript this is generally done from top to
            bottom from the first line to the last, however there are several structures that change
            control flow such as loops, conditionals and functions.
          </p>
          <h4>Conditional Statements</h4>
          <p>
            Conditional Statements are used when you need to perform different actions based on
            different conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most basic conditional statement is an <strong>if statement</strong>. For example,
            in your house the simple task of answering the door when someone rings the doorbell
            could be expressed as an if statement:
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>if (doorbellRings) {
  answerTheDoor();
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            This is great! However, sometimes we may not want to always open the door! It depends
            who it is that is there. We need a more complex logic than simply opening the door to
            everyone. For that we can use a combination of nested if statements as well as
            <strong>if-else</strong> statements when we need a second option:
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>if (doorbellRings) {
  personAtDoor = whoIsIt();
  if (personAtDoor == 'Jehova's Witness') {
    silentlyBackAway();
  } else {
    answerTheDoor();
  }
}</code></pre>
          <h4>Loops</h4>
          <p>
            Loops allow us to create iterable sections in our code. This allows us to repeat a
            sequence of steps multiple times until there is nothing left to loop over or a certain
            condition is met.
          </p>
          <p>
            A simple way to think of a loop is to think of a task you do daily in which you may
            repeat the steps more than once. For example let us imagine a workout routine at the gym
            where we have a set exercise (for example, a bicep curl) that we wish to complete for a
            certain number of "reps" or in programming speak we would call these the "iterations".
          </p>
          <p>
            We could write some pseudo-code for this routine, where each line is a step as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>let rep number equal 0
while rep number is less than 10 do the following:
  perform a bicep curl
  increase rep number by 1, go back to step (line) 2</code></pre>
          <p>In JavaScript this could be written with a <strong>while loop</strong> as so:</p>
          <pre>
<code>let rep = 0;
while (rep &lt; 10) {
  bicepCurl();
  rep += 1;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Let's examine what is happening here... First of all we declare a variable named "rep"
            and set it to an initial value of 0. Next we create the whlie loop using the keyword
            "while" followed by the condition in parentheses. In this case we want the loop to keep
            executing as long as the value for rep is less than 10. We then use the opening curly
            brace "{" to specify the beginning of a code block which contains the statements we want
            to execute during the loop. The first statement is performing the action of the bicep
            curl itself, which I have modelled here as a function. The next step, which is
            <em>very</em> important is to increase the value of the looping variable otherwise we
            will end up in an infinite loop! Finally we close off the loop block with the closing
            curly brace "}". As an aside, you will notice we begin counting at 0 and not 1, which is
            common in computer programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the code executes and comes across the while loop, it will first check the
            condition statement (in the parentheses) - and provided the condition evaluates as true,
            the body of the loop (inside the curly braces) will execute line by line until it
            reaches the end (the closing curly brace), then the condition will be checked again and
            if it still evaluates as true it will repeat the loop.
          </p>
          <p>It could also be written with a <strong>for loop</strong> as so:</p>
          <pre>
<code>for (let rep = 0; rep &lt; 10; rep++) {
  bicepCurl();
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            As you can see this code is more succinct than the while loop. The for loop places the
            looping variable, the condition statement and the loop variable increment all within the
            parentheses. The way it works however is exactly the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's take this analogy a bit further.. What if rather than performing just one set of
            the exercise we want to do multiple sets? For this we can use
            <strong>nested loops</strong>. Let's look at our pseudo-code first:
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>let set equal 0
while set number is less than 3 do the following:
  let rep number equal 0
  while rep number is less than 10 do the following:
    perform a bicep curl
    increase rep number by one, go back to step (line) 4
  take a rest
  increase set number by 1, go back to step (line) 2</code></pre>
          <p>Now as a <strong>while loop</strong>:</p>
          <pre>
<code>let set = 0;
while (set &lt; 3) {
  let rep = 0;
  while (rep &lt; 10) {
    bicepCurl();
    rep += 1;
  }
  takeRest();
  set += 1;
}</code></pre>
          <p>And as a <strong>for loop</strong>:</p>
          <pre>
<code>for (let set = 0; set &lt; 3; set++) {
  for(let rep = 0; rep &lt; 10; rep++) {
    bicepCurl();
  }
  takeRest();
}</code></pre>

          <h3>DOM - Document Object Model</h3>
          <p>
            The DOM is a data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content
            of a document on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DOM provides the interface between web pages and programming languages such as
            JavaScript by representing the structure of a document as a logical tree with each
            branch of the tree ending in a node and each node containing objects. The DOM is
            cross-platform and can be used with any programming language.
          </p>
          <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif" alt="HTML DOM Tree" />
          <p>The HTML DOM defines:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The HTML elements as <strong>objects</strong></li>
            <li>The <strong>properties</strong> of all HTML elements</li>
            <li>The <strong>methods</strong> to access all HTML elements</li>
            <li>The <strong>events</strong> for all HTML elements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The real power of the DOM is that through it we can use JavaScript to change the HTML
            document's structure by adding new HTML elements or deleting existing elements. We can
            also change it's style by adding/toggling classes on elements to which CSS rules have
            been defined for or adding inline style attributes directly to those elements. Finally,
            we also adjust an HTML's content such as changing the text.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can also attach event handlers to nodes to be able to trigger functions that respond
            to user interaction with the page such as page loads, mouse inputs, button clicks and
            key presses.
          </p>

          <h3>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects</h3>
          <h4>Array Acess</h4>
          <p>
            The first thing to know about arrays is that the position of each element is referred to
            as the <strong>index number</strong> with 0 being the index of the first element in the
            array, 1 being the second element and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            To access an element of an array we use bracket notation array[i] where i is the index
            number (position) of the element in the array. For example:
          </p>

          <pre>
<code>myArray = ["Dev", "Academy", "Is", "Cool"];
  
console.log(myArray[2]);
// => "Is"</code></pre>
          <h4>Object Access</h4>
          <p>
            The difference between accessing items in an array and items in an object is that
            objects store name:value pairs which are then accessed using the
            <strong>name</strong> rather than an index or position. The named values in objects are
            known as <strong>properties</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>Let's look at a simple object representing a person:</p>
          <pre>
<code>const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  "eye color": "blue"
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Some things to note, the property names are actually strings however if it is a single
            word the quotes may be omitted, like in the case of firstName, lastName and age. However
            beacause eye color is made up of two words, the string must be wrapped in quotes.
          </p>
          <p>
            To access properties on an object we can either use dot-notation or bracket notation.
            However dot-notation will only work if the property name is a single word, otherwise
            bracket notation is required.
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>console.log(person.firstName);
// => "John"

console.log(person["lastName"]);
// => Doe

console.log(person.eye color);    // won't work

console.log(person["eye color"]);
// => "blue"
</code></pre>
          <p>Bracket notation is also required to be used when working with variables:</p>
          <pre>
<code>let prop = "age";
console.log(person[prop]);
// => 50
</code></pre>
        </section>

          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <p>
            Functions provide us with a way to structure larger programs and can help reduce
            repitition. It allows us to break up our code into smaller, more manageable units
          </p>
          <h4>Defining a Function</h4>
          <p>
            There are multiple ways to define a function. The most basic is a
            <strong>function definition</strong> (also called a
            <strong>function declaration</strong>). It consists of the keyword
            <code>function</code> followed by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function</li>
            <li>
              A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and seaparated by commas
            </li>
            <li>
              The statements which define the function enclosed in curly brackets <code>{...}</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The code below is for a simple function that takes a number as an input, and returns the
            square of that number:
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>function square(x) {
  return x * x;
};</code></pre>
          <p>
            The above function takes a single <strong>parameter</strong> <em>x</em> which is listed
            inside the parentheses in the function definition. This parameter behaves like a local
            variable inside the function body. Now that we have defined the function, we now have to
            <strong>call</strong> the function. When we call the function, if the function has
            parameter(s), we pass in values for those parameters as
            <strong>arguments</strong> inside the parentheses.
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>let result = square(5);
console.log(result);
// => 25
</code></pre>
          <p>
            In the above function call we pass in the integer 5 as an argument, the function then
            squares this number and returns the result which we assign to a variable named 'result'.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can also create functions using a <strong>function expression</strong>. In which we
            assign a function to a variable, this function can be <strong>anonymous</strong>, it
            does not have to have a name:
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>const square = function(x) {
return x * x;
};</code></pre>
