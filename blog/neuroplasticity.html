          <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <h4>What is Neuroplasticity?</h4>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to restructure or rewire itself in order to
            learn and adapt. Traditional thinking was brains became fully developed when you reached
            adulthood however there is growing evidence and recognition that this ability to
            restructure can occur throughout life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefits of neuroplasticity is it allows us to train our brain just like how we
            would train our muscles to become stronger, in order to develop or keep our mental
            fitness and resilience. It doesn't matter if you are 9 or 90!
          </p>
          <h4>How does it work?</h4>
          <p>
            Neutroplastic change occurs at the chemical, structural and functional levels of the
            brain
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Chemical Change</strong> - Occurs in the initial stages of learning something
              new. Primarily influences short-term memory or short-term improvement of a motor
              skill.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Structural Change</strong> - Occurs when neurons in the brain change their
              connections, altering your brain structure through the creation of new neurons and
              neural connections. This type of change requires more effort and time and involves
              long-term memory and long-term improvement of a motor skill.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Functional Change</strong> - Occurs when entire brain networks change. Brain
              networks become more excitable and more efficient when they are activated over and
              over.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>How can we harness the power of Neuroplasticity?</h4>
          <p>
            On average, cognitive declines begins between the ages of 20 and 30. Just like an unused
            motor can seize up, our brain too can become degraded and the only way to prevent this
            from happening is with a life of continual learning and challenging the brain on a daily
            basis. It is truely a case of "use it or lose it".
          </p>
          <p>Therefore it is key to exercise the brain and there are numerous ways to do so:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Video Games</strong> - There are numerous benefits associated with playing
              video games including motor co-ordination, visual recognition and spatial navigation,
              memory and reaction time, reasoning, decision making and problem solving skills as
              well as teaching the skills of resilience and teamwork.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exercise</strong> - Exercise has been shown to improve cognitive abilities
              like learning and memory. It promotes blood flow and cell growth in the brain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Travel</strong> - Exposure to new environments leads to synaptogenesis, which
              is the creation of new neural connections in the brain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sleep!</strong> - Sleep is important to the brain and helps with learning and
              memory retention. Naps are good.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Food</strong> - walnuts, blueberries, avacado. Vitamind D and magnesium are
              important nutrients.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Other ways to enhance neuroplasticity:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn a language or play a musical instrument</li>
            <li>Non-dominant hand exercises</li>
            <li>Yoga</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Fasting</li>
            <li>Brain training games</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
          <h4>What is it?</h4>
          <p>
            A growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can be developed, this leads to a
            desire to learn and therefore a tendency to embrace challenges, persist in the face of
            setbacks, see effort as the path to mastery, learn from criticsm and find lessons and
            inspiration in the success of others. As a result, those with a growth mindset are able
            to reach even higher levels of achievement than those with a fixed mindset who instead
            tend to run from difficulty and give up easily. A growth mindset gives you a greater
            sense of free will and that your effort and persistence is a determiner of your success
          </p>

          <h4>Integrating into my learning journey</h4>
          <p>
            To integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey I will praise and reward effort
            rather than results or grades. I will see learning as a continual process and just
            because I am not capable of doing something now, does not mean that I am incapable or
            unintelligent, it just means that I have not yet developed the ability (embrace the
            power of yet). I will seek out challenges even if there is a chance of failure and
            instead see it as an opportunity to grow. I will not be afraid to seek help or admit
            when I don't know something, rather than seeing it as making me look stupid instead I
            will view it as a learning opportunity.

          <ul>
            <li>Embrace your imperfections</li>
            <li>Process more important than the end result</li>
            <li>Stop seeking approval of others - enjoy the learning process</li>
            <li>Growth is more important than speed - learning takes time</li>
            <li>Cultivate a sense of purpose - keep a gratitude journal</li>
            <li>Talent is 99% hard work, 1% genius</li>
            <li>Embrace criticism</li>
            <li>"room for improvement" rather than "failure"</li>
            <li>Take time to reflect</li>
