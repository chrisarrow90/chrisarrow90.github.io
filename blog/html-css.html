          <h3>Differences between relative, absolute and fixed positioning</h3>
        </header>

        <section>
          <h4>Relative Positioning</h4>
          <p>
            When an element is given the property <code>position: relative;</code> it remains
            positioned according to the normal flow of the document. Initially, nothing will happen
            unless an offset is applied. To apply an offset, you add the additional property of
            either <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code> or
            <code>left</code> with the value representing the offset <em>relative</em> to itself
            (from it's normal position). The element position remains according to the normal flow
            of the document. <strong>Note:</strong> The property <code>left</code> does not move the
            element left, it is the offset value from the left edge (in other words, element will
            move right)
          </p>

          <h5>Example</h5>
          <p>
            In the example below, box two has been given a relative position and offset values of
            20px from top and 20px from left. Notice how this has no affect on the position other
            elements. The offset value is relative to its original position in the normal flow (blue
            outline)
          </p>
          <div class="position-example">
            <div class="box" id="one">One</div>
            <div class="box-outline"></div>
            <div class="box" id="two">Two</div>
            <div class="box" id="three">Three</div>
            <div class="box" id="four">Four</div>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Absolute Positioning</h4>
          <p>
            When <code>position: absolute;</code> is applied to an element, it is removed from the
            normal document flow. It will be postioned relative to its closet positioned ancestor,
            if any, otherwise relative to the initial containing block (i.e the html)
          </p>

          <h5>Example</h5>
          <p>
            In the example below, box two has been given an absolute position and offset values of
            20px from top and 20px from left. The element is removed from the normal flow and the
            other elements are positioned as if it didn't exist. Since the box is a inside a
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> container with <code>position: relative</code> set on it, the
            offset value is relative to the edge of that container
          </p>
          <div class="position-example">
            <div class="box" id="one-abs">One</div>
            <div class="box" id="two-abs">Two</div>
            <div class="box" id="three-abs">Three</div>
            <div class="box" id="four-abs">Four</div>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Fixed Positioning</h4>
          <p>
            When <code>position: fixed;</code> is applied to an element, it is removed from the
            normal document flow and positioned relative to the initial containing block established
            by the viewport or browser window. This can be used to create a "floating" element that
            stays in the same position regardless of scrolling and is useful for navigation bars at
            the top of a page.
          </p>
          <iframe
            class="fixed-position-example"
            src="fixed_position_example.html"
            frameborder="0"
          ></iframe>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>
            In summary only <strong>relative positioning</strong> keeps element in the normal flow.
            Using either <strong>absolute</strong> or <strong>fixed</strong> positioning removes the
            element from the normal flow and other elements will behave as if it didn't exist. You
            can then position the element how you want including making it overlap with other
            elements
          </p>
          <p>
            The real difference between <strong>absolute</strong> and <strong>fixed</strong> is an
            element with an absolute position will positioned relative to it's containing block
            (nearest positioned ancestor), if there is no positioned ancestor, then the viewport
            will be the containing block. An element with a fixed position however, remains
            stationary in the viewport window in all cases and is not affected by scrolling. This is
            particularly useful for navigation bars.
