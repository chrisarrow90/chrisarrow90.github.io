          <h3>Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
          <h4>What is my long term goal and/or Career Pathway?</h4>
          <p>
            Explore a future career shift into the IT industry, either into a Full-Stack web
            development role or into software development.
          </p>

          <h4>What are my strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h4>
          <p>Strengths - highly motivated, fast learner</p>
          <p>Weaknesses - staying focussed and not letting attention divert to something else</p>

          <h4>
            What skills (non-technical - human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while
            at EDA?
          </h4>
          <p>
            I would really like to work on my collaborative skills and gain more confidence in
            public speaking and presentations.
          </p>

          <h4>How will I manage my workload during this programme?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I will make Weekly/Daily plans to keep track of what I need to do</li>
            <li>I will utilise Toggle to keep track of time spent on activities</li>
            <li>I will work in an environment free from distractions</li>
            <li>I will take regular breaks to keep a fresh mind and maximise my producitivity</li>
            <li>
              I will work with my Cohort and Facilitators to maintain accountability of one another
            </li>
            <li>
              If I am feeling overwhelemed, I will take a break and do some exercise, go for a walk
              and clear my head. If I am stuck on a problem, I will reach out to others for support
              and guidance
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</h4>
          <p>
            I will use Slack as the platform to communicate with other students and the faciliation
            team
          </p>

          <h4>What I expect from the facilitation team?</h4>
          <p>
            I expect them to guide me in my learning rather than just give me the answers to my
            questions in order to help me grow as a developer. I expect to receive constructive
            criticism in both my technical and soft skills with advice on how to improve
          </p>

          <h4>What scheduling conflicts do I have and how will I plan around these?</h4>
          <p>
            At this point I do not have any real scheduling conflicts, just daily gym routine that I
            will organise around the course
          </p>

          <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
          <h4>What is my long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
          <p>
            My goal is still to seek a full stack web development job. I have a stronger preference
            towards working on backend as I believe that is were my real strengths are.
          </p>

          <h4>What will my biggest strengths and limitations in Bootcamp be?</h4>
          <p>
            I believe my organised nature, high levels of motivation and flexibility will be my
            biggest strengths. My biggest limitations will be overcoming my introverted personality.
          </p>

          <h4>What will be my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp?</h4>
          <p>
            I think it will be split between two areas: keeping focus for the full 10 weeks, and
            also public speaking in front of a group audience especially if it has to do with
            personal reflection
          </p>
          <h4>
            What non-technical skills (human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while
            at EDA?
          </h4>
          <p>
            I would like to develop my collaboration and pair programming skills and also develop my
            leadership capability.
          </p>

          <h4>What are my expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
          <p>
            To assist in a helpful manner and help me grow. To receive open and honest feedback and
            advice.
          </p>

          <h4>What are my expectations of myself on Bootcamp?</h4>
          <p>
            My expectations are to maintain focus, stay on top of the workload, and to give 100%
            towards the course. I will co-operate with and interact with the other members of my
            cohort in a helpful and friendly manner and help each other maintain accountability.
