          <h3>What is my long term goal and/or Career Pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            Explore a future career shift into the IT industry, either into a Full-Stack web
            development role or into software development.
          </p>

          <h3>What are my strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h3>
          <p>Strengths - highly motivated, fast learner</p>
          <p>Weaknesses - staying focussed and not letting attention divert to something else</p>

          <h3>
            What skills (non-technical - human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while
            at EDA?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I would really like to work on my collaborative skills and gain more confidence in
            public speaking and presentations.
          </p>

          <h3>How will I manage my workload during this programme?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I will make Weekly/Daily plans to keep track of what I need to do</li>
            <li>I will utilise Toggle to keep track of time spent on activities</li>
            <li>I will work in an environment free from distractions</li>
            <li>I will take regular breaks to keep a fresh mind and maximise my producitivity</li>
            <li>
              I will work with my Cohort and Facilitators to maintain accountability of one another
            </li>
            <li>
              If I am feeling overwhelemed, I will take a break and do some exercise, go for a walk
              and clear my head. If I am stuck on a problem, I will reach out to others for support
              and guidance
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</h3>
          <p>
            I will use Slack as the platform to communicate with other students and the faciliation
            team
          </p>

          <h3>What I expect from the facilitation team?</h3>
          <p>
            I expect them to guide me in my learning rather than just give me the answers to my
            questions in order to help me grow as a developer. I expect to receive constructive
            criticism in both my technical and soft skills with advice on how to improve
          </p>

          <h3>What scheduling conflicts do I have and how will I plan around these?</h3>
          <p>
            At this point I do not have any real scheduling conflicts, just daily gym routine that I
            will organise around the course
