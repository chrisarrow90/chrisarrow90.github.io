            <h3>What is my long term goal and/or Career Pathway?</h3>
            <p>Explore a future career shift into the IT industry, either into a Full-Stack web development role or into software development.</p>

            <h3>What are my strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h3>
            <p>Strengths - highly motivated, fast learner</p>
            <p>Weaknesses - staying focussed and not letting attention divert to something else</p>
        
            <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at EDA?</h2>
            <p>I would really like to work on my collaborative skills and gain more confidence in public speaking and presentations.</p>
          
            <h3>How will I manage my workload during this programme?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>I will make Weekly/Daily plans to keep track of what I need to do</li>
              <li>I will utilise Toggle to keep track of time spent on activities</li>
              <li>I will work in an environment free from distractions</li>
              <li>I will take regular breaks to keep a fresh mind and maximise my producitivity</li>
              <li>I will work with my Cohort and Facilitators to maintain accountability of one another</li>
              <li>If I am feeling overwhelemed, I will take a break and do some exercise, go for a walk and clear my head. If I am stuck on a problem, I will reach out to others for support and guidance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</32>
            <p>I will use Slack as the platform to communicate with other students and the faciliation team</p>

            <h3>What I expect from the facilitation team?</h3>
            <p>I expect them to guide me in my learning rather than just give me the answers to my questions in order to help me grow as a developer. I expect to receive constructive criticism in both my technical and soft skills with advice on how to improve</p>

            <h3>What scheduling conflicts do I have and how will I plan around these?</h3>
            <p>At this point I do not have any real scheduling conflicts, just daily gym routine that I will organise around the course</p>
